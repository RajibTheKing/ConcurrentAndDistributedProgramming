(RS0 , WS0) + (RS1, WS1)  orElse       (RS1, WS0) T2


free: WS1  \ (WS0 and RS1)


t0 : writeTVar t7 42 
t1 : writeTvar t7 73 

N.B:
Read set and Write set.... must be immutable data structure
If we use mutable data structure... then it will be really hard to handle . 


remote read is not possible
remote write is possible in erlang

why?
parts of internet crash..... 
to maintain robustness.
